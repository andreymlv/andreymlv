### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrey Malov, a student from Russia.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science.

I use Artix Linux on a regular basis. NeoVim is my main code editor.
I am interested in new technologies, but I am also constantly studying not very mainstream technologies: forgotten and not very programming languages.

If you want to hire me, then I won't mind =)
