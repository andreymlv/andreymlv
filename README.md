### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrey Malov, a student from Russia.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science.

I use Arch Linux (and [NixOS now](https://github.com/andreymlv/nixos-config/)) on a regular basis. [Neovim](https://github.com/andreymlv/nvim) is my main code editor.
I am interested in new technologies, but I am also constantly studying not very mainstream technologies: forgotten and not very popular programming languages.

My favorite color theme is gruvbox <3

If you want to hire me, then I won't mind =)
